# Hi, I'm Kenneth ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer passionate about crafting responsive, accessible interfaces with React and Tailwind CSS.  
I also work with WordPress and am exploring full-stack tools like Next.js and Supabase.  
Currently seeking junior front-end opportunities and collaborative projects!
